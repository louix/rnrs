# Changelog

## 0.2.0

- Faster scalar calls and numeric-array input conversion on native and web.
- Input fields and array elements now use ordinary JavaScript reads, including
  inherited values and getters. Output property semantics are unchanged.
- Earlier, actionable errors for incompatible generated wrappers and native builds.
- Validated surface rendering, touch input and Worklets on a physical iPhone;
  surface touch combined with Gesture Handler remains untested.

Upgrade `@rnrs/cli`, `@rnrs/runtime` and `@rnrs/surface` (if used) together.
Regenerate bindings and rebuild native apps; this is not a JS-only update.
Rust module dependencies should use the `0.2` framework crate versions.
The TypeScript-spec and Rust-implementation authoring API is unchanged.
